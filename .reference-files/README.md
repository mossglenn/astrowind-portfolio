# üóÇÔ∏è Reference Files

This directory serves two purposes:

1. **Quick Reference**  
   Files copied here from previous work, experimental prototypes, or inspirational examples.
   These are useful for reference or exploration but are not currently used in the build.

2. **Staging Area for Future Assets**  
   Assets (e.g., images, fonts, HTML fragments, SCORM packages) that are intended to be used
   in this project eventually, but are not yet placed in their final location. This helps avoid
   premature directory structure decisions and keeps the main project tree uncluttered.

‚ö†Ô∏è Files here are ignored by linting, formatting, and version control by default.  
Move files into `src/`, `public/`, or `components/` as they become actively used.
